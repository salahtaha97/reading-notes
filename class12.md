# Chart.js, Canvas
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

## Setting up
The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script.
## Drawing a line chart
To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page,Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element.
## Drawing a pie chart
Our line chart is complete, so let’s move on to our pie chart. First, we need the canvas element,Next, we need to get the context and to instantiate the chart,Next we need to create the data. This data is a little different to the line chart because the pie chart is simpler, we just need to supply a value and a color for each section.

example:
- <!DOCTYPE html>
- <html lang="en">
-    <head>
-       <meta charset="utf-8" />
-        <title>Chart.js demo</title>
-        <!-- import plugin script -->
-        <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
-    </head>
   - <body>
    -    <!-- line chart canvas element -->
     -   <canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
-  <!-- pie chart canvas element -->
        <canvas id="countries" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
        <!-- bar chart canvas element -->
        <canvas id="income" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
        <script>
            // line chart data
            var buyerData = {
