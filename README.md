***The growth mindset*** is meaning is the belief that skills and intelligence can be improved with effort and deliberate practice, a growth mindset isnâ€™t only important at an individual level. It is also vital for businesses at an organizational level. Studies show that when management promotes a growth mindset among team members, they encourage learning, development, and new ideas.

1. ***Look for opportunities, not obstacles.***
2. ***Think positive.***
3. ***Work on self-motivation.***
