# Audio, Video, Images

## image in HTML 
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

1. src - Specifies the path to the image
2. alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.

### Example
- <img src=".gif" alt=" face" width="42" height="42" - - style="vertical-align:bottom">
- <img src=".gif" alt=" face" width="42" height="42" style="vertical-align:middle">
- <img src=".gif" alt=" face" width="42" height="42" style="vertical-align:top">
- <img src="" alt="Smiley face" width="42" height="42" style="float:right">


## Practical Information

a <section> element with a class of info-box, which contains a <ul> and a <div>. The unordered list contains three list items with links inside, which will become the actual tabs to click on for displaying our content panels. The div contains three <article> elements, which will make up the content panels that correspond to each tab.
