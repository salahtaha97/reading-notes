# Forms in HTML

## form:
An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.
The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input.

The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

example:
- <form>

## event in JS
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
