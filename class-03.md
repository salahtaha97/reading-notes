# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS
## List in HTML
* HTML *lists* allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.
Two types of lists:

1. Unordered HTML List
An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
2. Ordered HTML List
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

## The CSS Box Model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
Explanation of the different parts:

* Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.
* Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
* Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.
* Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 

## Decision Making in JavaScript
Like other languages, JavaScript also provides many decision making statements like if, else etc.

* if statement

if is used to check for a condition whether its true or not. Condition could be any expression that returns true or false. When condition satisfies then statements following if statement are executed.
