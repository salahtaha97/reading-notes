# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Links in HTML:
* HTML links are hyperlinks.
* You can click on a link and jump to another document.
* When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
* The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
(<a href="url">link text</a>).

## layout:
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
- <header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
- <nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
- <section> - Defines a section in a document
- <article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
- <aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- <footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
- <details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
- <summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

## JavaScript Functions:
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}.
